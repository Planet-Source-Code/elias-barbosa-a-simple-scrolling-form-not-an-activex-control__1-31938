### Description

This is a control that will allow you to create a form that can be scrolled by the user. It is very simple to implement.

This submission is heavily based on another submission by Fred_Cpp:

I hope that Fred doesn't get mad at me for tweaking his code! :)

My modified version has little changes. When there is no need to scroll horizontally or vertically, the scroll bar is hidden. The scroll bars do not have the annoying blinking anymore. I did a lot of clean up on the code and added a few comments in "English".

I think that the example looks better, too.

It would be good if you guys could give me some feedback.

I have just uploaded an ActiveX Control that is much better. The URL Is:
